# ΩMEGUN
Game by Milan Gruner, Auxence Fromont, Joshua Nawrozki, David Uecker, Astri.

Made during GMTK Jam 2019 with Godot Engine.

Only one gun to end all of existence. Only ony life. Only one try.

Pick up the weapons that your enemies leave behind and glue them to your weapon to create the ΩMEGUN! Travel through time and space to maintain the balance in the universe.
